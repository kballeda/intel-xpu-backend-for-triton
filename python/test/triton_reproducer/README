Overview
~~~~~~~~

# This reproducer reads good/bad SPV files provided in dumps.tar (GSD-7949) and launches the SYCL kernel in C++.


Environment
~~~~~~~~~~
    1. source /opt/intel/oneAPI/2024.0.0/setvars.sh 
    2. Set PATH variable pointing to Intel Level Zero headers

Directories
-----------

data       - This directory contains all the binary files (.bin) consisting of input/output array binary data dumped from Triton backend 
             [Arrays: a, b, Torch_output, Triton_output]
src        - This directory contains all the source files 
spirv-bins - This directory contains SPIRV binary dumps from Triton, these files contains actual kernels in encrypted form.
             good.spv   - Picked from GSD-7949/dumps.tar/good directory
             bad.spv    - Picked from GSD-7949/dumps.tar/bad directory

Reproducer [GSD-7949]
---------------------
make            - By default it builds the tritonspvc++.exe (Reproducer for GSD7949)
                  It utilizes the input data of a/b/torch output (th.bin)/Triton output (tt.bin) from data directory
                  It picks SPIR-V kernel binary from spirv-bins directory underwhich good.spv and bad.spv are present.

make VERBOSE=1  - Enables logging of Output Results

make DEBUG=1    - Enables debug mode


Usage:

./tritonspvc++.exe [By default it picsk good.spv and produces correct results in comparison with Triton/Torch]
./tritonspvc++.exe --spv ./spirv-bins/bad.spv [Produces wrong results in comparison with Torch]
